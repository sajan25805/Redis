Setting Expiration on Keys:

EXPIRE key seconds: Sets an expiration time (in seconds) for a key.
PEXPIRE key milliseconds: Sets an expiration time in milliseconds for a key.
EXPIREAT key timestamp: Sets an expiration time based on a UNIX timestamp.








`TTL` (Time To Live) is a command used to determine the remaining time for an expiration set on a key. It essentially returns the number of seconds until the key's expiration.
